fix: Correct dispute status logic and add real-time chat support

- Fixed dispute status logic across all components:
  - RESOLVED_SUCCESS now correctly shows "resolved in favor of merchant"
  - RESOLVED_FAIL now correctly shows "resolved in favor of trader"
- Updated status colors, badges, and filters to match correct logic
- Added socket.io-client dependency for real-time chat
- Implemented DisputeMessagesRealtime component with WebSocket support
- Added protection against null/undefined values in dispute lists
- Temporarily disabled WebSocket imports until socket.io-client is installed
- Added installation script for socket.io-client package
